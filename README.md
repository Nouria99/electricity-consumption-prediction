Sure! Here's a clear and easy-to-read bullet point version of your GitHub project description:

---

### üîç Project Description

* Built a machine learning model to predict monthly household electricity consumption using Python
* Cleaned and preprocessed real-world energy data
* Engineered new features such as energy consumption per square meter and occupants per square meter
* Developed and compared three models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression
* Used cross-validation and multiple performance metrics (R¬≤, RMSE) for evaluation
* Presented results with visualizations for better interpretability


### üõ† Tools & Skills Used

* **Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Techniques**:

  * Data cleaning and preprocessing
  * Feature engineering
  * Dummy variable creation
  * Outlier handling
  * Regression modeling
  * Cross-validation and model comparison
* **Soft Skills**: Critical reasoning, problem-solving, and model selection based on evidence
